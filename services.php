      <h3 class="ser-h3">Solo</h3>
      <p class="ser-text">While working solo, our drivers have a flexible schedule and firm delivery appointment. With the safety of the drivers and the load in mind, most of the driving hours of a solo driver are done in the day time. After the load
        is delivered, the driver can decide if they want to take the next load or take some days off.</p>

    <div class="team">
      <h3 class="ser-h3">Team</h3>
      <p class="ser-text">While driving in a team, both the drivers are equally responsible for delivering the cargo in time and secure manner. Team drivers are almost twice as fast as the solo drivers, so they reach their destination faster and
        return home for a nice break. The payment will be equally divided between the two drivers by us so there are no conflicts between them.</p>
