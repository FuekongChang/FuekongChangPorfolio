      <h3 class="ser-h3">$4-Year Plan$</h3>
      <div class="dry"></div>
      <p class="about-text">The begining of my four year plan was going to be to start at a Fresno City collage so I can get my basic education out of the way and to be able to save money so I dont have to pay alot after collage.I then will try to apply for the colleges I want to get into and also to ready myself for the classes I have to take for the major I want to get into.After I figure out that then I would look for a job that can sustain me and the place I would like to live though I think that I am going to stay with my family just for two years so I don't have to worry about water and electricity bills for a while.I thought about this plan for a while because my family always would nag about what college or what do you want to do and what what not to do but now this is for me and only me.For my next years of collage is would be ether at Fresno State or Fullsail University too.The reason why for those two is because Fresno State is closer to me and I know a bit about the whole school and the magor I'm trying to get into when I get accepted.Also for Full Sail University it has online course I can take so when I am late or I don't have a ride, I can take the courses online in the comfort of my home.Also when I'm done with at least two years of college I would like to go and live on my own or with one of my friends because I'm a grown up now I can take care of myself and I don't need to mooch off my parents forever but only if I need the support.After my two year plan I plan on looking into a feild that I can handle and work with.</p>
